# Harmony Component Library

Welcome to the Harmony Component Library! This library provides a collection of reusable, accessible, and customizable React components designed to help you build beautiful and consistent user interfaces.

## Getting Started

To use components from the Harmony library in your project:

```bash
npm install @harmony/ui
# or
yarn add @harmony/ui
# or
pnpm add @harmony/ui
```

## Design Principles

Our component library is built with the following principles in mind:

1. **Accessibility First**: All components are built with accessibility in mind, following WCAG guidelines and best practices.
2. **Customization**: Components are highly customizable through props and CSS variables.
3. **Consistency**: A consistent design language across all components.
4. **Performance**: Optimized for performance with minimal bundle size impact.

## Theme System

The Harmony library uses a comprehensive theming system that allows you to:

- Customize colors, typography, spacing, and other design tokens
- Switch between light and dark modes
- Create custom themes for your application

## Component Categories

Our components are organized into several categories:

- **Layout**: Components for structuring your application's layout
- **Navigation**: Components for building navigation interfaces
- **Forms**: Form controls and input components
- **Data Display**: Components for displaying data and content
- **Feedback**: Components for providing user feedback
- **Overlay**: Modal, popover, and other overlay components

## Best Practices

When using the Harmony component library:

1. Always import components individually to optimize bundle size
2. Use the provided theme tokens instead of hardcoding values
3. Follow the accessibility guidelines provided with each component
4. Utilize the composition patterns demonstrated in the examples
